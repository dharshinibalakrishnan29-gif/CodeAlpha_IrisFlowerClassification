# CodeAlpha_IrisFlowerClassification
This repository contains the Iris Flower Classification project completed as part of the CodeAlpha Data Science Internship. The project uses machine learning techniques to classify iris flower species based on sepal and petal measurements using Python and Scikit-learn.

Iris Flower Classification with Visualization:

This project:
.Loads the Iris dataset
.Visualizes the data using graphs
.Trains a Logistic Regression model
.Predicts flower species
.Evaluates model accuracy

Technologies Used:
.Python
.Pandas
.Matplotlib
.Seaborn
.Scikit-learn

Dataset Information
.Dataset: Iris Dataset (from sklearn)
.Total Samples: 150

Features:
.Sepal Length
.Sepal Width
.Petal Length
.Petal Width

Classes:
.Setosa
.Versicolor
.Virginica

Data Visualization
The following visualizations are used:
.Scatter Plot (Petal Length vs Petal Width)
.Pair Plot (Feature relationships with species)
These plots help in understanding the distribution and separation of flower species.

Machine Learning Model
.Algorithm: Logistic Regression
.Train-Test Split: 80% Training, 20% Testing
.Performance Metric: Accuracy Score

Output:
 The model predicts the species of Iris flowers and provides an accuracy score.

Example:
Model Accuracy: 0.96
